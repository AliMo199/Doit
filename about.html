                <p><span class="first-character atw">I</span>n today’s digital age, maintaining productivity and
                    organizing tasks has become essential for everyone, from busy professionals to students. However, I
                    found that many existing to-do list applications and websites often come with unnecessary
                    complications. When you search for a simple to-do list tool on Google, you are bombarded with
                    options that require you to sign up, log in, and navigate through a plethora of features that you
                    may not need. This can be overwhelming and counterproductive for users who just want a
                    straightforward way to manage their daily tasks. <br><br>

                    This realization inspired me to create a more user-friendly to-do list application. My goal was to
                    develop a tool that is simple, intuitive, and accessible without the need for cumbersome
                    registration processes. By focusing on the core functionalities—adding, completing, and deleting
                    tasks, along with offering a dark mode for ease of use at night—I aimed to create an application
                    that truly meets users' needs without any unnecessary hurdles. <br> <br>

                    Moreover, as a student in Computer Science, I have always been passionate about developing practical
                    applications that can make everyday tasks easier. During my studies, one of the first projects we
                    were assigned was to implement a to-do list using various programming languages such as C++. This
                    early exposure to building a to-do list application not only helped me understand the fundamental
                    concepts of programming but also sparked my interest in creating software solutions that enhance
                    productivity. <br><br>

                    Combining these experiences, my project, DOIT, was born. It is a simple yet powerful tool designed
                    to help users organize their tasks efficiently, without the need for complex sign-up processes. This
                    project reflects my journey in computer science and my desire to create solutions that are both
                    practical and user-centric.</p>
